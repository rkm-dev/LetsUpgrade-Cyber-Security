## Since my system can't support running multiple VM's, I created instances in aws

## 2 windows server 2016 instances, one served as a ftp server and other as a client

## 1 linux machine to run the arpspoof and dsniff, as sir said it didn't capture anything from the client machine, even after using the private ip's, probably because of the aws routing securities.

## but the arpspoof continued to spoof the ip address and dsniff was capturing random aws snmp packets.
