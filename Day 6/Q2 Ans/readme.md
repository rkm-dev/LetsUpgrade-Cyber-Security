## Since my system can't support running multiple VM's, I created instances in aws

## Two windows server 2016 instances, one served as a ftp server and other as a client

## One linux machine to run the arpspoof and dsniff, 
##     as sir said it didn't capture anything from the client machine, even after using the private ip's, probably because of the aws routing securities.

## But the arpspoof continued to spoof the ip address and dsniff was capturing random aws snmp packets.
